Exercise 2: Logistic Regression

This project is an R re-implementation Exercise 2: Logistic Regression from the Coursera 
Machine Learning course.

The intention of this series of example exercises is to demostrate how
the machine learning algorithms discussed in the Coursera course might be
implemented in R, since that is a common request in the discussion forums.
It is hoped that the student will use these examples after they have taken
and passed the Coursera course to better understand the material and R.
Translating this code back to GNU Octave for the purpose of submition for
the Coursera course is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code, and is 
explicitly against the wishes and intent of the author.
